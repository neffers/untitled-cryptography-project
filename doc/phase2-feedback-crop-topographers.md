## Comments

### Documentation

Are there any "groups" of accesses beside Moderator? Can users be demoted from
Moderator to lower privilege? Can they be promoted to Moderator? Later, we will
ask you to protect resources even in the scenario where the users with access
are changing. If this is not possible, please extend your system to include this
functionality. (Alternatively, allow for non-public leaderboards that are shared
with specific groups of users, and allow users to be added to and removed from
groups.)

Global vs. private leaderboards came up in your demo, but i can't find anything
about this in your documentation. Please clarify this for the future. If this
functionality is already present, you can extend it by assigning access via
groups to address the previous comment.

Really thorough documentation (aside from the one comment above).

### Demo results

Functionality worked as expected.
